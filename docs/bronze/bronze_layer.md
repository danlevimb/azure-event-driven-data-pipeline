# Bronze Layer

## 1. Purpose

The Bronze layer is responsible for **raw data ingestion**.

It captures events as they arrive from Event Hub and applies **basic structural validation**, without enforcing business rules.

---

## 2. Why Bronze Exists

This layer ensures that:

* Original data is always preserved
* Invalid data is not lost, only separated
* Downstream layers are protected from malformed events

It acts as the **entry checkpoint of the pipeline**.

---

## 3. Validation Strategy

Validation at this stage is limited to **schema-level checks**:

* Required fields must exist
* Payload structure must be valid
* Data types must be correct
* Basic constraints (e.g., non-negative order_total)

Reference:

* `validate_event()` → 

No business rules are applied at this stage.

---

## 4. Output Zones

Events are separated into two zones:

* `validated/` → structurally correct events
* `rejected/` → invalid events with error details

Rejected events include:

* Validation errors
* Original payload
* Ingestion timestamp

This allows full traceability and debugging.

---

## 5. Storage Design (Data Lake)

The Bronze layer is stored in **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2**, using container-based organization.

Each layer corresponds to a container:

* `bronze` (this layer)
* `silver`
* `gold`

Within the Bronze container, data is organized using a **date-based partitioning strategy**:

```text
bronze/
├── validated/
│   └── year=YYYY/month=MM/day=DD/
│
└── rejected/
    └── year=YYYY/month=MM/day=DD/
```

This structure is generated dynamically at write time.

Reference:

* `write_event()` → 

---

## 6. Value Provided

The Bronze layer provides:

* **Data traceability** → original events are always preserved
* **Error isolation** → invalid data does not affect downstream layers
* **Reprocessing capability** → raw data can be replayed if needed
* **Scalability** → partitioned storage enables efficient data handling

---

## 7. Summary

The Bronze layer is the **foundation of the pipeline**.

It guarantees that all incoming data is:

* Captured
* Validated structurally
* Properly categorized

Without applying transformations that could compromise data integrity.
